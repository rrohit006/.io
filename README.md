[(View Project)](https://github.com/rrohit006/Numerical-Techniques-in-Engineering)

Numerical techniques in engineering involve using mathematical methods and algorithms to solve engineering problems that may not have analytical solutions or where analytical solutions are difficult to obtain. Here are some common numerical techniques used in engineering along with a brief overview of each:
1. **Root-Finding Methods:**
   - **Bisection Method:** Iteratively narrow down the interval containing a root by evaluating the function at the endpoints and identifying the subinterval where the function changes sign.
   - **Newton-Raphson Method:** Use the tangent line to iteratively approach the root of a function.
2. **Linear Algebraic Equations:**
   - **Gaussian Elimination:** A method for solving systems of linear equations through row operations to transform a system into an upper triangular form.
   - **LU Decomposition:** Decompose a matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U) to simplify the solution of linear systems.
3. **Interpolation and Extrapolation:**
   - **Lagrange Interpolation:** Construct a polynomial that passes through a set of given points to approximate a function.
   - **Newton's Divided Difference Interpolation:** An iterative method to calculate interpolation coefficients based on divided differences.
4. **Numerical Integration:**
   - **Trapezoidal Rule:** Approximate the definite integral of a function by dividing the area under the curve into trapezoids.
   - **Simpson's Rule:** A more accurate method that uses quadratic polynomials to approximate the integral.
5. **Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs):**
   - **Euler's Method:** A simple numerical method for solving first-order ODEs by approximating the solution at discrete points.
   - **Runge-Kutta Methods:** Higher-order methods for solving ODEs, such as the classical fourth-order Runge-Kutta method.
6. **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs):**
   - **Finite Difference Method:** Discretize PDEs using finite differences to approximate derivatives and convert the problem into a system of algebraic equations.
   - **Finite Element Method:** Divide the domain into small elements and approximate the solution over each element using piecewise functions.

### 03. Simulation of Thin-Film Solar Cells based on (CCZTSe) Using (SCAPS-1D) Program
[(View Project)](https://github.com/rrohit006/Simulation-of-Thin-Film-Solar-Cells-based-on-CCZTSe-Using-SCAPS-1D-Program)

To simulate thin-film solar cells based on CCZTSe (copper zinc tin selenide) using the SCAPS-1D program, you'll need to follow specific steps. SCAPS-1D (Solar Cell Capacitance Simulator in 1 Dimension) is a widely-used simulation tool for studying the performance of various types of solar cells. Here's a general guide on how to set up and perform a simulation:

1. **Installation**: First, ensure that you have SCAPS-1D installed on your system. You can typically download it from the official website or from a trusted source.

2. **Input File Preparation**: Prepare an input file that contains all the parameters necessary for simulating the CCZTSe thin-film solar cell. This includes material properties, device geometry, doping profiles, etc.

3. **Define Material Properties**: Specify the material properties of CCZTSe, including its bandgap, electron affinity, dielectric constant, etc. These properties are crucial for accurately simulating the behavior of the solar cell.

4. **Device Structure**: Define the structure of the thin-film solar cell, including layer thicknesses, doping concentrations, and any additional layers or interfaces (e.g., buffer layers, window layers).

5. **Simulation Settings**: Set up the simulation settings, such as temperature, illumination conditions, and any other relevant parameters. These settings will determine how the simulation is run and what data is output.

6. **Run Simulation**: Once the input file is prepared and all settings are configured, run the simulation using the SCAPS-1D software. The program will use the provided parameters to simulate the performance of the CCZTSe thin-film solar cell under the specified conditions.

7. **Analysis**: After the simulation is complete, analyze the results to gain insights into the behavior of the solar cell. This may involve examining characteristics such as current-voltage (I-V) curves, external quantum efficiency (EQE), and carrier concentration profiles.

8. **Optimization**: Based on the simulation results, you may need to optimize the device structure or material properties to improve the performance of the CCZTSe solar cell. This iterative process may involve making adjustments to parameters and rerunning the simulation until satisfactory results are achieved.

It's important to note that simulating thin-film solar cells using SCAPS-1D requires a good understanding of semiconductor physics and device modeling. Additionally, accurate input parameters and material properties are essential for obtaining reliable simulation results. If you're new to using SCAPS-1D or simulating solar cells in general, it may be helpful to consult the software documentation and/or seek guidance from experts in the field.

### 04. Electrical Wiring Installation & Cost Estimation (Considering Safety Issues)
[(View Project)](https://github.com/rrohit006/Electrical-Wiring-Installation-Cost-Estimation)

Using AutoCAD for electrical wiring installation and cost estimation involves several steps. AutoCAD is primarily a drafting software, so it's useful for creating detailed drawings of electrical layouts. However, for cost estimation, you might need to integrate it with other software or manually calculate the costs based on the design. Here's a general guide on how to approach electrical wiring installation and cost estimation using AutoCAD:
![OutPut View](/img/0_1.png) 
1. **Drawing the Electrical Layout**:
    - Start by creating a new drawing file in AutoCAD.
    - Draw the floor plan or layout where the electrical wiring will be installed. This includes walls, doors, windows, and other relevant features.
    - Use AutoCAD's electrical symbols and tools to draw components such as outlets, switches, lights, circuit breakers, and wiring routes. You can find these symbols in AutoCAD's libraries or download additional symbol libraries if needed.
    - Ensure that your drawing is accurately scaled to represent the actual dimensions of the space.

2. **Creating Wiring Diagrams**:
    - Draw wiring diagrams to illustrate how electrical components are connected and the routing of wires. This helps electricians understand the installation process.
    - Label components and wires appropriately to avoid confusion during installation.

3. **Material List Generation**:
    - Manually create a list of materials needed for the electrical installation based on your drawing. This includes wires, cables, outlets, switches, circuit 
      breakers, conduit, junction boxes, etc.
    - Assign quantities and specifications to each item in the list.

4. **Cost Estimation**:
    - Research the prices of electrical materials and components from suppliers or hardware stores.
    - Calculate the total cost of materials by multiplying the quantity of each item by its unit price.
    - Consider additional costs such as labor, permits, overhead, and contingencies.

5. **Integration with Cost Estimation Software** (Optional):
    - Export the material list from AutoCAD to a spreadsheet format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
    - Use specialized cost estimation software or plugins that can import the material list and perform cost calculations automatically.
    - Some construction estimating software packages offer integration with AutoCAD and provide tools for generating cost estimates directly from CAD drawings.

Remember to consult local building codes, regulations, and standards when designing electrical installations. Additionally, involve qualified electricians or electrical engineers to review your designs and ensure compliance with safety requirements. While AutoCAD can streamline the design process, accurate cost estimation often requires additional tools or manual calculations based on the design specifications.
